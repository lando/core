 * this should be the same as the v3 "compose" service but we are stealth loading it in core so that we can
 * use it for testing when the cli is decoupled from its plugins. you shouldnt really use it directly but theoretically
 * it should have the same docs as https://docs.lando.dev/compose/ except with "type: lando"
 *
 * we've named it "type: lando" as it most closely resembles the new lowest level typed v4 service which is also named
 * lando
