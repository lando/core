    # app-mount: false|disabled|off|0
    # # build.app consequences
    # app-mount: false -> build.app is not run at all
    # app-mount: bind -> build.app is run with docker run
    # app-mount: copy -> build.app is run as part of image build
    # app-mount:
    #   type: bind
    #   target: /app
    #   excludes: -> named volumes
    # app-mount:
    #   type: copy

    # note: what about something like excludes in v3?
