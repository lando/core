# L-337 Service

::: tip ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT!
This is currently in active development. We encourage you _trying it out_. We discourage you _relying on it_.
:::

The `l337` service is the lowest level `api: 4` service and it implements **L**ando Specification **337** which is so low level that it's too low to be the default service. That means you need to explicitly set `type: l337` to use it.

In high level terms it combines _service orchestration_ and _image specification_ into a single file format.

Specifically, it is a light superset around the [Docker Compose Version 3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/) format that also uses the [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) specification.

This means that you _should_ be able to paste Docker Compose and/or Dockerfile compatible contents into your Landofile, add `api: 4` to each service and have it "just work".

As noted above **L**ando Specification **337** extends the Docker Compose 3 spec with Dockerfile stuff. That means that everything in both of those specs is supported by default. So this is a valid Landofile:

***Landofile***
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  # this is a Lando 3 php service
  php:
    type: "php:7.4"
    api: 3

  # these are Lando 4 "l337" services
  web:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: "nginx:1.15"
    networks:
      my-network:
    volumes:
      - "./:/app"
      - "my-data:/data"
  db:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    build:
      dockerfile: "./Dockerfile"
networks:
  my-network:
volumes:
  my-data:
```

OK cool, got it, but how does Dockerfile stuff factor in? What is actually different in the spec besides `api`?

**Two questions.**
<br>_One Answer_: `image`

**That's it.**

## Image

Lando Specification 337 is identical to the Docker Compose spec with the exception of the `image` key which now handles different string inputs and has an extended object format for **MOAR POWAH**.

The string input for `image` has been extended and now allows the below:

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  # a valid registry image, eg the original Docker Compose usage
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: "nginx:1.21"

  # a path to a Dockerfile compatible file
  example-2:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: "./images/nginx/Dockerfile"

  # raw Dockerfile compatible instructions
  example-3:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: |
      FROM nginx:1.21
      ENV HELLO there
      ...
      CMD run-stuff

```

You can extend `image` into object format to get access to more features. Here is an example that implements all the keys available in object format.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: "nginx:1.21"
      tag: "pirog/nginx:1.21"
      buildkit: true
      ssh: false
      args:
        vibe: rising
      context:
        - "./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
      groups:
        - reallllllearly: -8675309
      steps:
        - instructions: "RUN id > /tmp/user"
          group: "reallllllearly"
        - instructions: |
            ENV VIBES rising
            RUN id > /var/ww/index.html
          group: "reallllllearly-10-before-root"
```

### Imagefile

The `image` string notation format above actually populates the `imagefile` key behind the scenes. For that reason, this usage is the same as above but with a different key.

::: tip Use context instead of COPY/ADD
While you _can_ use `COPY` and `ADD` instructions here we recommend you use [`context`](#context) instead. See [this](#_3-copy-add-considerations) for more information.
:::

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  # a valid registry image
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: nginx:1.21

  # a path to a Dockerfile compatible file
  example-2:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: ./images/nginx/Dockerfile

  # raw Dockerfile compatible instructions
  example-3:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: |
        FROM nginx:1.21
        ENV HELLO there
        ...
        CMD run-stuff
```

Note that you can also use `dockerfile` instead of `imagefile` if you prefer that usage. If you use both `imagefile` will win.

### Build Args

You can pass in [build args](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/build-args/) that are then used by your `image` instructions. Both `array` and `object` notation is permissible but `object` is probably better.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  build-args-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      args:
        - nginx=1.19.2
        - vibe=rising
        - something
      dockerfile: "./images/nginx/Vibefile"
  build-args-2:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      args:
        nginx: 1.21.5
        vibe: dialed
        something:
      imagefile: |
        ARG nginx=1.21.4
        FROM nginx:${nginx}
        ARG vibe
        ENV VIBE=${vibe}
```

Array formatted `key=value` pairs are trimmed in both `key` and `value`. Args with no `value` are ignored as in `something` above.

### Buildkit

If _for some reason_ you prefer to use the old pre-BuildKit image builder you can toggle this to `false`.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  # use the legacy builder
  example-1:
    api: 4
    buildkit: false
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: nginx:1.21
```

Note that if you do `buildkit: false` some image build features, specifically those in [Dockerfile 1.1.0+](https://docs.docker.com/build/dockerfile/release-notes/#110) and the [ssh](#ssh) features of this service, may not be available. You can also use `buildx` as an alias for `buildkit`. If you use both it will evaluate to `true` if either is `true`. Really just don't use both ;)!

You probably should just ignore this setting unless you have a well understood reason to do otherwise.

### Context

If you would like to `COPY` and/or `ADD` files into your build context and image then use `context`. Many forms and options are supported:

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: "nginx:1.21"
      context:
        # COPY ./folder to /folder
        - "./folder"

        # COPY ./folder to /thing
        - "./folder:thing"

        # COPY file1 to /file2
        - "file1:/file2"

        # COPY file1 to /file3
        - src: "file1"
          dest: "file3"

        # COPY file1 to /file4
        - source: "file1"
          destination: "file4"

        # COPY ./images/Dockerfile to /images/Dockerfile
        - source: "./images/Dockerfile"

        # COPY file1 to /file6 and set ownership to nginx:nginx with perms 775
        - source: "file1"
          destination: "file6"
          owner: "nginx:nginx"
          permissions: "775"

        # COPY file1 to /file7 and set ownership to nginx:nginx
        - source: "file1"
          destination: "file7"
          user: "nginx"
          group: "nginx"

        # ADD HeresAHealthToTheCompany.json
        # to /SeaShanties/lyrics/main/shanties/HeresAHealthToTheCompany.json
        - source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaShanties/lyrics/main/shanties/HeresAHealthToTheCompany.json"

        # ADD available-shanties.json
        # to /etc/config/available-shanties.json and set ownership to blackbeard
        - source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaShanties/lyrics/main/available-shanties.json"
          dest: "/etc/config/available-shanties.json"
          owner: "eddie-teach"
```

### Groups

`groups` allow you to organize [`steps`](#steps).

By default every `l337` service has two groups, `default` and `context`, with the following values:

```yaml
context:
  description: "A group for adding and copying sources to the image"
  weight: 0
  user: "root"
default:
  description: "A default general purpose build group around which other groups can be added"
  weight: 1000
  user: "root"
```

You can add additional groups into your Landofile and then use them in your `steps`.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: "nginx:1.21"
      groups:
        # adds a group called "val-jean" with weight "24601"
        # uses root user by default
        - val-jean: 24601

        # adds a root user group called "system" that runs first
        - name: "system"
          description: "Install system packages and stuff"
          weight: -10000
          user: "root"

        # adds a nginx user group called "user" that runs last
        - name: "user"
          description: "Allows for user run commands after other groups"
          weight: 10000
          user: "nginx"

```

### SSH

If your image build requires access to `ssh` keys you have a few options:

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: Dockerfile
      # make all passphraseless keys and $SSH_AUTH_SOCK available
      ssh: true

  example-2:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: Dockerfile
      # only make the keys available
      ssh:
        agent: false
        keys: true

  example-3:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: Dockerfile
      # only make the agent available
      ssh:
        agent: true
        keys: false

  example-4:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: Dockerfile
      # use particular agent and keys
      ssh:
        agent: /run/ssh/agent.pid
        keys:
          # can use a key
          - /home/.ssh/id_special
          # or load all the keys in a dir
          - /home/.ssh-more

  example-5:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: Dockerfile
      # use particular agent via envar and a single key
      ssh:
        agent: $SSH_AUTH_SOCK_THING
        keys: /home/.ssh/id_rsa
```

As you can see its pretty configurable but we recommend that in most cases you just set `ssh: true` if you need `ssh` stuff as this is going to be your most portable option.

Here is a concrete example that uses a passphrase protected key that is first loaded into the `ssh-agent` and a few other passphrase-less keys that are in `~/.ssh`.

**Keys**

```
~/.ssh/id_passphrased
~/.ssh/id_no_pp_1
~/.ssh/id_no_pp_2
```

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      ssh: true
      imagefile: |
        FROM debian

        # will clone with $SSH_AUTH_SOCK which contains id_passphrased
        RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=agent git clone git@github.com:lando/lando.git /lando2

        # will clone with either id_no_pp_1 or id_no_pp_2
        RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=keys git clone git@github.com:lando/lando.git /lando

        # will clone with id_no_pp_1
        RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=id_no_pp_1 git clone git@github.com:lando/lando.git /lando3
```

**Execution**

```sh
# start agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# add passphrase protected key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_passphrased

# rebuild images
lando rebuild
```

Here are some additional notes on this feature:

* Passphrase protected keys can be used but only if added to your host `ssh-agent` _before_ image build
* This feature is not available if you set `buildkit: false`
* The keys/agent are only available when explicitly mounted in a `RUN` instruction they **DO NOT** end up in the resulting image

### Steps

While you _can_ specify an entire Imagefile's contents directly in `image.imagefile` it's often better to use `steps` which are ordered and partial Dockerfile-compatible instructions.

Because `steps` are wrapped in a standardized and ordered layer, Lando and any of its plugins can insert `instructions` into the resulting `imagefile` wherever they make the most sense. This allows for great flexibility.

However, we are mostly interested here in how `steps` can be used directly in a Landofile.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  example-1:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: "nginx:1.21"
      groups:
        ... # as defined [above](#groups) and omitted here for brevity
      steps:
        # insert string instructions into the default group
        - instructions: |
            ENV VIBES RISING
            RUN apt-get update -y
            RUN /my-script.sh

        # insert array format instructions into the default group
        # See: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerfile-generator for syntax
        - instructions:
          - env:
              KIRK: "wesley"
              SPOCK: "peck"
          - run: "env"
          - run:
            - "stat"
            - "/tmp"

        # insert group detached, one-off, singleton, instructions
        # at arbitrary weight
        - instructions: "ENV PIKE mount"
          weight: 1001
        - instructions: |
            RUN echo "last" >> /stuff
          weight: 999
        - instructions: |
            RUN echo "first" >> /stuff
          weight: 1

        # insert instructions into groups
        - instructions: |
            ENV KIRK pine
            ENV SPOCK quinto
            RUN id > /system-user
          group: "system"
        - instructions: "RUN id > /tmp/user"
          group: "user"

        # insert instructions using group-override format
        # runs -4 weight units before the system group
        - instructions: |
            ENV KIRK shatner
            ENV SPOCK nimoy
          group: "system-4-before"
        # run 10 weight units after the user group but uses the root user
        - instructions: |
            ENV KIRK shatner
            ENV SPOCK nimoy
          group: "user-10-root"
```

Note that if you specify both a `group` and a `weight` the step will run at the `weight` regardless of the weight of the group. Generally it's a good idea to not use both `group` and `weight` in the same step.

If you reference a `group` that does not exist then the `default` group will be used.

#### COPY/ADD

While you _can_ use `COPY` and `ADD` instructions here we recommend you use [`context`](#context) instead. See [this](#_3-copy-add-considerations) for more information.

#### Override syntax

The group override syntax is flexible as long as the parent group is first. For example the following overrides are equivalent:

```bash
system-2
system-2-after
system-root-after-2
system-2-after-root
system-root-2-after
```

That said, we like the `GROUP-OFFSET-DIRECTION-USER` format. ;)

Also note that it is totally possible to have defined two `groups` like `system` and `system-4`. In this scenario a `step` using the `system-4` group will actually use the `system-4` group and not override the `system` group with a `4-after` offset.

Since this can easily get confusing it's best to be careful when defining your group names.

### Tag

If you wish to force Lando to use a particular tag on successful image creation, you can.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  tag-me-bro:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image:
      imagefile: |
        FROM nginx:1.21
        ENV SERVER=apache
        ENV CONFUSED=true
      tag: "loki/apache:1.21"
```

## Caveats

As you may have already suspected because the `l337` service sits _below_ the main [`lando`](./lando.md) service it lacks **_ALL_** the features in that service. Using it is _pretty close_ to just using Docker Compose/Dockerfiles straight up.

Said another way, you should really only use this service directly if you are _intentionally_ looking to avoid normal Lando features or want to use something that is more-or-less like Docker Compose.

That said, here are the things that make it _pretty close_ but not identical to Docker Compose/Dockerfiles:

### 1. Auto app mount discovery

If you `volume` mount your app root directory then Lando will assume its mount destination as the app mount for tooling purposes. Consider the following example:

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  my-service:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: "php:8.2-cli"
    volumes:
      - "./:/home"
tooling:
  pwd:
    service: "my-service"
```

Note that changing the directory on the host also changes the location at which `lando pwd` is executed within the container:

```bash
lando pwd
# /home
cd subdir && lando pwd
# /home/subdir
```

### 2. Working dir support

If you do not mount your app root directory as above then Lando will use `working_dir` to set the default tooling `dir` for that service.

**Landofile**
```yaml
name: "my-app"
services:
  my-service:
    api: 4
    type: l337
    image: "php:8.2-cli"
    working_dir: "/var/www"
tooling:
  pwd:
    service: "my-service"
```

 Note that `lando pwd` still executes in the `working_dir` location, even though we change directories on the host machine:

```bash
lando pwd
# /var/www
cd subdir && lando pwd
# /var/www
```

### 3. COPY & ADD considerations

While you _can_ use the `COPY` and `ADD` instructions in various places in the `l337` service we recommend you use our [`context`](#context)convention instead. The `tl;dr` there is it will be more performant.

The full explanation is that if Lando detects a `COPY` or `ADD` instruction it will automatically copy the _entire_ application root into the build context. So if you have a **BIG APP** this can drastically slow build performance.

If for some reason you need `COPY/ADD` to work eg you are basing your service on some preexisting Dockerfile with some build assets then we recommend you copy the build assets and Dockerfile into a subfolder and build from there. In this case only the files in that subfolder will be used and not the entire application.
